# Radiography-Based-Diagnosis-Of-COVID-19-Using-Tranfer-Learning
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network based on VGG16 architecture to diagnose COVID-19 and classify chest X-rays of patients suffering from COVID-19, Ground Glass Opacity and Viral Pneumonia. This repository contains the link to the dataset, python code for visualizing the obtained data and developing the model using Keras API.
